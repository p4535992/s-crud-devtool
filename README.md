# s-crud-devtool
Automate S-CRUDE Operation [jsp/servlet]

++ what this Repid development tool can do

+ write DAO (Data Access Object ) 

	so it can encapsulate the logic for retrieving, saving and updating data in your data storage (a database)
	  
	It allows you to work with any of MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle, and IBM DB2 SQL servers as well as SQlite and H2 embedded database libraries (right now only Mysql is configured rest of will configure soon)


+  it simplifies the tedious job of writing boilerplate, repetitive code to access databases tables from Java Servlets or Java Server Pages ( JSP )

+ s-crud devtool 
here "s" belongs to search Action & crud means create - read - update - delete


# recent active development 
remove hard-coded JDBC queries & add Hibernate ORM support

# goal
add angular 4 as front-end [kind of big deal, b'coz it will force me to rewrite lots of code]
